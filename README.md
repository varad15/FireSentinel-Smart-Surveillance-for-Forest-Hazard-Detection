ðŸ”¥ FireSentinel: Smart Surveillance for Forest Hazard Detection
A cutting-edge, AI-powered surveillance system for real-time wildfire and hazard detection in forest environments. Leverage deep learning, computer vision, and the cloud to safeguard ecologies and communities.

ðŸŒ² Overview
FireSentinel utilizes advanced deep learning models, edge-computing cameras, and centralized cloud-based dashboards to detect, alert, and help mitigate wildfire risks and other hazards in forested regions. The system is designed for reliability, scalability, and integration with existing emergency infrastructure.

âœ¨ Features
Real-Time Hazard Detection:
Deploys YOLO-based neural networks to identify smoke, flames, and fire sources from video streams.

Edge Surveillance:
Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano powered smart cameras process video locally, minimizing network bandwidth.

Cloud Dashboard:
Monitor all cameras, view live alerts, and manage hazard events from a sleek, web-based portal.

Instant Alerting:
Automated notifications via SMS, email, and dashboard popups ensure responders are alerted when every second counts.

Event Logging:
All detections with location, time, and image/video evidence are recorded for analysis and compliance.

Heatmap Visualization:
Visual display of hazard-prone areas to aid in pro-active forest management.

Easy Deployment:
Plug-and-play scripts, Dockerfiles, and comprehensive documentation.
