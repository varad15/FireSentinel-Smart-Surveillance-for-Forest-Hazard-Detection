# ðŸ”¥ FireSentinel: Smart Surveillance for Forest Hazard Detection

*AI meets ecologyâ€”real-time wildfire risk detection for safer, smarter forests.*

---

## ðŸŒ² Project Description

FireSentinel is an advanced, AI-driven, full-stack surveillance solution for early detection and management of forest fires and related hazards.

Designed for forest authorities and environmental agencies, FireSentinel unifies edge-based deep learning, robust streaming, and central dashboards to monitor vast landscapesâ€”minimizing response time and maximizing ecological protection.

## ðŸš€ Core Features

- **Real-Time Hazard Recognition:**  
  Detects smoke, flames, and fire using deep neural networks on live camera feeds.

- **Edge AI Nodes:**  
  Deploys on Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nanoâ€”processing images locally to reduce bandwidth and latency.

- **Unified Cloud Dashboard:**  
  Aggregates and visualizes all alerts, device statuses, and historical event logs for rapid assessment.

- **Automated Multi-Channel Alerts:**  
  Instantly notifies rangers or emergency teams via SMS, email, and dashboard pop-ups.

- **Heatmaps & Analytics:**  
  Pinpoint and monitor historical high-risk areas on interactive maps.

- **Privacy & Security:**  
  Communicates critical data only; all access is role-based.

## ðŸ§  System Architecture Overview

- **Edge Camera Nodes:**  
  Local device runs object detection, sends only alert frames or events to the cloud.

- **Cloud Backend:**  
  Central server receives, stores, and escalates hazard events; supports web dashboard.

- **Web Dashboard:**  
  Allows operators to view live alerts, historical logs, and analytics in one place.

## ðŸ“Š Key Technologies

- **Deep Learning:** YOLOv5 / YOLOv8 (fire and smoke detection), PyTorch
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV for low-level camera and image processing
- **IoT/Edge Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, standard web cameras
- **Backend:** FastAPI / Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** Modern web dashboard interface
- **Geo-Visualization:** Folium/OpenStreetMap
- **Messaging:** Email, SMS, WebSocket alerting for incident response
